# Revenge of the Lawn

Revenge of the lawn is a roguelike movement only game with RPG elements - currently just a proof-of-concept. 

The idea is [vampire survivors](https://poncle.itch.io/vampire-survivors) but you're mowing the lawn instead of killing zombies.

A player is dropped intoa suburban landscape and prompted to mow lawns to win upgrades.

While moving around via on-screen joystick and working towards your goal - you're swarmed by mounstrous venus fly traps.

After completing a lawn, a player is prompted to upgrade their fuel capacity, or the blade of their lawnmower.
